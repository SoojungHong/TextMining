@k-means algorithm for English 

@About : k-means creates k groups from a set of objects so that the members of a group are more similar. Itâ€™s a popular cluster analysis technique for exploring a dataset.

# whiten : Normalize a group of observations on a per feature basis.
#          Before running k-means, it is beneficial to rescale each feature dimension of the observation set with whitening. Each feature is divided by its standard deviation across all observations to give it unit variance.
